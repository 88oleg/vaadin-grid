This folder contains the Vaadin Valo theme source files to produce the
appropriate CSS file per component.

To compile it read the documentation about the gulp task 'css' in
the [parent](../README.md) file.

Each component folder is expected to contain a file with the same name as the
folder name, e.g. the "button" folder should contain the "button.scss" file.
